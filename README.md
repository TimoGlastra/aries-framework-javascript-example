# Aries Framework JavaScript Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Aries Framework JavaScript to create a simple agent that can connect to other agents and exchange messages.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.JS 18+ & Yarn installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/TimoGlastra/aries-framework-javascript-example.git

cd aries-framework-javascript-example

yarn install
```

## Running

After running you should see a QR code in the terminal. This is a shortened out of band v1 invitation url, and can be scanned with a mobile agent.

```
yarn start
```
